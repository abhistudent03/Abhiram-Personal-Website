      <li><a href="[link-to-paper1](https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10070821)">Paper 1</a> –In Staphylococcus aureus, there are 15 two-component systems, and the study identified ArlRS and VraSR as especially important in protecting the bacteria against ceftaroline. VraSR appears to play the dominant role, since the reintroduction of this single system was enough to restore resistance. These findings point to a potential new therapeutic approach: by targeting these systems, particularly VraSR, it may be possible to enhance the effectiveness of ceftaroline and other antibiotics against drug-resistant S. aureus.</li>
